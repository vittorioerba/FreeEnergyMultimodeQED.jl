# FreeEnergyMultimodeQED.jl julia library

A small library to reproduce the results of CITA

## Installation

To install the package to your local machine, you can use Julia's package manager [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl).
Start a Julia REPL, and run
``` 
    ] add https://github.com/vittorioerba/FreeEnergyMultimodeQED.jl.git
```

The code is documented through docstrings in the code, at least for all exported functions.
A list of exported functions can be found in [src/FreeEnergyMultimodeQED.jl](src/FreeEnergyMultimodeQED.jl).
To see what an exported function does, just use the bulit in Julia help
```
    ? function_name
```

## TODO

[ ] prepare a notebook illustrating the data processing 

[ ] prepare a notebook that reproduces the figures of the paper

[ ] upload data to the cloud
